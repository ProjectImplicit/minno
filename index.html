                <p>Minno.js is an open source JavaScript player for creating web studies in behavioral science (e.g., Psychology). It is free software for creating sophisticated questionnaires and reaction time tasks. The documentation describes the main components that researchers use when they create Minno.js studies.</p> 
                <p>These components are miManager, miTime, miQuest, and miMessage. In a typical experiment, researchers use miManager to define a sequence of miTime, miQuest, and miMessage tasks. For instance, in a study that examines whether general knowledge predicts performance in a Stroop task, the researcher would use miTime for the Stroop task, miQuest for the general knowledge questionnaire, miMessage for the consent form and the debriefing page, and miManager for setting the sequence of these tasks.</p>

                    <h3>minno-manager</h3>
                    <p>miManager presents a sequence of tasks (mostly, questionnaires, reaction-time tasks, and instruction pages). It supports various mechanisms for randomization, and for selecting tasks based on previous user response and on experimental conditions. Read more.</p>
                    <h3>minno-message</h3>
                    <p>miMessage is dedicated for creating pages with text (e.g., instructions). Although it is easy to show instructions in miQuest and miTime tasks, miMessage is often better for presenting independent web pages, such as the consent form and the study debriefing. Like all the other components, miMessage supports dynamic construction of the presented text, based on previous user response and the experimental condition.</p>

                    <h3>minno-time</h3>
                    <p>miTime builds and runs tasks typical for cognitive psychology (reaction-time tasks). miTime runs a sequence of trials, and supports various mechanisms for randomization of trials and stimuli. Each trial describes a sequence of events (mostly, stimulus presentation and keyboard and mouse responses). Because Minno.js is JavaScript-based and does not require any installation on the participant's computer, time-precision is often inferior to the precision typically achieved with common tools for lab studies. From our experience, experiments with Minno-Time obtain results similar to those obtained with lab experiments. However, it is nearly impossible to guarantee that timing was 100% accurate for all participants in all trials. For example, assuring subliminal presentation of stimuli is unlikely. MiTime accepts mouse and keyboard input, supports presentation of images and text, and is compatible with all major browsers. Read more.</p>

                    <p>miQuest builds and runs questionnaires. It runs a sequence of pages, each with a sequence of questions. miQuest supports open-ended questions, multiple-choice questions, grids, sliders (visual analog scale), and ranking. It supports various mechanisms for question randomization, and for selecting questions based on previous user response and experimental conditions.</p>

### Education

Here are some presentations good for introducing the essentials of the PI system:

* You can expeirence an internal workshop Project Implicit conducted by visiting [this document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bDJYaNuVKaABL26SANU0U4EOSFOHF4RkOUT-fLzhCBQ/edit). It has a link to a youtube playlist with a few lectures, but it is probably better to skip those and focus on completing the three exercises that we had in the workshop. 
* A lab presentation about integrating miManager with Project implicit, including comparison to `expt` files: [presentation](http://slides.com/andydzik/deck), [sample study](https://dw2.psyc.virginia.edu/implicit/showfiles.jsp?user=andy&study=sample/pimanager).
* A [presentation](http://eladzlot.github.io/pi-presentations/basics.html) focused on various features of the sequencer.

### Extensions

The PI tasks are easily extensible.

[Yoav Bar-Anan](http://www.bgu.ac.il/~baranany/) from [Project Implicit](https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/aboutus.html)
has created several extensions for the easy creation of a few common reaction-time tasks. 
You can find the instructions for using them right [here](https://git.io/JvE5H).
